- Evaluate migration from Netlify to Vercel

- Start git branch feat for the experimental terminal UI

- For ~/projects, experiment with ReactBits: Card Swap and Scroll Stack, evaluate if one of them can be used for displaying ~/projects
  - Card Swap: (Current favorite) set the card of Card Swap to being a terminal like in the hero, and put in the header text on each card eg. ~/projects/{project_name}. For the rest (title, content, git repo icon link, tech stack, etc.) maintain the existing internal layout of the project cards as it is.

- Consider performance
  - Less animations on mobile (and possibly on desktop too to avoid fans and heat)?
  - Pause/disable animations when viewport scrolled off from view?
