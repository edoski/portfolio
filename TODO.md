- Evaluate migration from Netlify to Vercel

- Start git branch feat for the experimental terminal UI

- See Safari ReactBits open tabs, evaluate if one of them can be used for displaying ~/projects
  - Favoring Card Swap, with header text on each card being eg. ~/projects/{project_name}, git repo icon link, etc.

- Add another section / terminal page called Curriculum Vitae/CV? and in terminal style renders out my CV?

- Create a footer at bottom of site
  - Or maybe the ~/contact terminal can be the footer, but idk makes more sense to have both that and an actual footer

- Consider performance
  - Less animations on mobile (and possibly on desktop too to avoid fans and heat)?
  - Pause/disable terminal-hero animations when viewport scrolled off from view?
